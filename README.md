Value investing with python

These scripts are aimed to anyone who wants to try to understand and find good investment possibilities by downloading from Alpha Vantage API the fundamental data of companies trading in Wall Street. 
This is to help you make as an informed choice as possible, this does not constitute the only due diligence to be done before investing. This is a starting point to facilitate the first and hardest part, that is looking and processing a large quantity of financial data about companies. 
I hope this is useful for people to better understand their portfolios, or help them create one.
