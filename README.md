Value investing with python

These scripts are aimed to anyone who wants to try to understand and find good investment possibilities by downloading from Alpha Vantage API the fundamental data of companies trading in Wall Street. 
This is to help you make as an informed choice as possible, this does not constitute the only due diligence to be done before investing. This is a starting point to facilitate the first and hardest part, that is looking and processing a large quantity of financial data about companies. 

If you have doubts in any of the ratios, and formulas I use, a good place to start to understand a little better all of this is Investopedia (https://www.investopedia.com/). Which I regularly use to look for formulas and to clarify what I am looking at in terms of the ratios, what is and what is not useful for me. This is always very personal and subjective to your knowledge, your aversion to risk, your experiences, etc.

This does not constitute any kind of investment advice, this is just information from which you will draw your own conclusions, and your own investment soundness. The opinions I leave in all of these scripts and readmes are my own vision, and can be mistaken. There is only one certainty, the future is known by no one.
I hope this is useful for people to better understand their portfolios, or help them create one.
